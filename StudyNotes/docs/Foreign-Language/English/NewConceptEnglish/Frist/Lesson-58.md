# Lesson 58：What's the time?（几点钟？）


## 一：如何表达“几点几分”？

### 1. 顺读法（past[经过]；half[一半]；a quarter[四分之一]）

#### 用法：分钟 past 小时（[小时] 过 [分钟]，表达过多少时间）

> 例：<br>
> ①：12:30<br>
> half <font color=orange>past</font> 12（12小时 过 一半，即 12:30）<br>
> ②：12:15<br>
> a quarter <font color=orange>past</font> 12（12小时 过 四分之一，即 12:15）<br>

<font color=red size=4>***需要注意的是，“ past ”的说法仅适用于“分钟 <= 30”的情况。**</font>


### 2. 倒读法（to[差]；half[一半]；a quarter[四分之一]）

<font color=red size=4>**“to”的说法适用于大于三十分钟以上的（不等于第三十分钟）**</font>

#### 用法：分钟 to 小时（[小时] 差 [分钟]，表示还有多少时间到）

**（60 - 分钟数）+ to +（小时数 + 1）*

> 例：<br>
> ①：11:45<br>
> a quarter <font color=orange>to</font> 12（差15分钟 到 12小时，即 11:45）<br>
> ②：12:50<br>
> 10 <font color=orange>to</font> 1（差10分钟 到 1小时，即 12:50）<br>
